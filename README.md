Template and tutorial to setup a bot using Microsoft Bot Framework.

Earlier this year in 2016, Microsoft released a Bot Development Framework which was designed to be a single framework to create Bots / Conversational UI across multiple surfaces (ex. Skype, Slack, Facebook messenger, and more). I decided to give it a shot recently and realized along the way that while there are great documentations online, you need to scavenge and jump around different sources to get a complete (and up-to-date code) view of how to initially get things rolling. For someone like myself who's never used Node.js, never deployed a web app to a cloud service, and never created a bot, it took some time to set everything up. I created this article as a note-for-self (and others like me) to easily get things started in the future.
